# Other Projects
This repository has projects that i have made for my own, which are not exercises from any course

## 1. Memory Game
A classic memory game made to practice javascript and CSS3 3D effects.
It's fully responsive.

[Enjoy](https://rawgit.com/FDMOliveira/Other-Projects/master/memory-game/index.html) :)

## 2. Musician Quotes
[MusicianQuotes](https://cdn.rawgit.com/FDMOliveira/Other-Projects/be8cd32/AjaxRequests/index.html) is a fully responsive web app that uses a ajax call to read a JSON object from a file that is on the server.

From that file, the *HTML* gets the name of the musician player, the musician quote, and the musician picture converted in base64 format to save a http request.
